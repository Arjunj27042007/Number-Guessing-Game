# Number-Guessing-Game
In this game, the computer will guess a number. After that, it will ask us to guess it. If we give a smaller number, it will say 'Nope, a little bit higher.' If we give a larger number, it will say 'Nope, a little bit lower.' If we guess the correct number, it will say 'You guessed it correctly!'
