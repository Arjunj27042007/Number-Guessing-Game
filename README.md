# Number-Guessing-Game
In this game, the computer first selects a number. After that, it asks us to guess it. If we enter a smaller number, it will say, "Nope, a little bit higher." If we enter a larger number, it will say, "Nope, a little bit lower." When we guess the correct number, it will say, "You guessed it correctly!"

This game is programmed  in Python.I programmed it in VS Code.
